# Chronic Diseases Prediction

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to predict chronic diseases using machine learning techniques. The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Null value treatment
- Outlier detection and handling
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Model deployment 

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of medical records with various health-related features. The preprocessing steps ensure data quality by addressing missing values and outliers.

### Features:
- **Age**: Patient's age
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- **Blood Pressure**: Systolic and Diastolic pressure
- **Cholesterol Levels**: LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol
- **Glucose Levels**: Fasting blood sugar levels
- **Heart Rate**: Resting heart rate
- **Smoking History**: Whether the patient is a smoker or non-smoker
- **Physical Activity**: Activity levels per week

### Target Variable:
- **Disease Presence**: Binary classification (0: No Disease, 1: Disease Present)

## 🛠 Installation
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## 🔬 Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values with mean/median imputation
- Removing or capping outliers based on IQR
- Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding
- Normalization and standardization of numerical variables

## 🤖 Model Training
Several machine learning models are tested and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Data visualization for better understanding
- Feature importance analysis
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- ROC and AUC curves for performance analysis
- Interpretation of predictions for medical insights

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Implementing deep learning models for better accuracy
- Deploying the model using Flask or FastAPI
- Expanding dataset with more features for better generalization
